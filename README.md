## Project Overview

### 1. Introduction:
Our project revolves around leveraging time-series analysis to predict Safaricom's stock prices. Using advanced analytics on historical market data and key macroeconomic factors, we aim to extract crucial insights and build a robust predictive model for future stock prices.

### 2. Problem Statement
The challenge lies in the inherent unpredictability of Safaricom's stock movements. Our focus is on constructing a robust predictive model through advanced time-series analysis to unravel critical patterns in Safaricom's historical data. This predictive model aims to offer a reliable forecast of future stock prices, aiding stakeholders in navigating the complex and uncertain financial markets.

### 3. Objectives
Main Objectives
Develop a robust time-series forecasting model for Safaricom's stock prices.

## Specific Objectives
To Identify opportune times to buy and sell Safaricom stocks to maximize returns by analyzing historical data, market trends and economic indicators to pinpoint optimal entry and exit points for various project stakeholders.

To conduct sensitivity analysis to assess how inflation rate variations, interest rate, and GDP affect the model's predictions. This can be achieved by simulating different economic scenarios above and understanding how these changes affect stock price forecasts.
